# caloryTrackerWebapp

Small, self-hostable calory/exercise/weight tracker flask application.

## Things to be done (in no particular order):
- Change deletion logic to use ids. The current approach is dumb though should work as long as user does not have two entries with the exact same timestamp
- Weekly/monthly views for records
- Weight monitoring
- Improve error handling. Currently if something goes wrong error is only logged to browser console (if even that)
